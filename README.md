Workshop Description
====================

Statistics courses usually use clean and well-behaved data for examples and
homework. This leaves many students unprepared for the messiness and chaos of
data in the real world. This workshop aims to prepare you for dealing with messy
data by walking you through real-life example.

This is an intermediate/advanced R course appropriate for those with basic
knowledge of R.

Prerequisites and Preparation
=============================

Prior to the workshop you should:
- install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
- install the `tidyverse` package in R with `install.packages("tidyverse")`
- download the workshop materials from <https://github.com/izahn/R-data-cleaning/archive/v0.1.zip.
